The goals for this project is to:
* complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
* complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
* write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
* write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet with the exception of q and e.
* write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
* write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99, using comma as separator.
* write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
* write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
* write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
* write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
